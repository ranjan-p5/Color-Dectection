# Color-Dectection
This project is an interactive Computer Vision application that identifies colors in images or real-time video feeds. By utilizing OpenCV for image processing and Pandas for data handling, the application calculates the RGB values of a specific pixel and maps them to the nearest color name from a dataset of over 800 colors.
